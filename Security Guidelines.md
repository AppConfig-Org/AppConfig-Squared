# Security Guidelines for AppConfig¬≤

AppConfig¬≤ is built with enterprise-grade security as a fundamental principle. This document outlines our security approach, compliance measures, and best practices.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### Zero Trust Security Model
AppConfig¬≤ implements a comprehensive Zero Trust architecture:

- **Never Trust, Always Verify** - Every request is authenticated and authorized
- **Principle of Least Privilege** - Minimal required permissions only
- **Continuous Verification** - Ongoing validation of user identity and device trust
- **Encrypted Everywhere** - End-to-end encryption for all data in transit

### Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls protect the application:

```

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### Microsoft Entra ID Integration
- **Native Integration** - Direct integration with Microsoft Entra ID
- **Conditional Access Support** - Full compliance with conditional access policies
- **Multi-Factor Authentication** - MFA enforcement for enhanced security
- **Single Sign-On** - Seamless SSO experience across Microsoft ecosystem

### Permission Model
- **Delegated Permissions** - All operations performed on behalf of signed-in user
- **Just-In-Time Access** - Permissions requested only when needed
- **Scope-Based Authorization** - Granular permission scoping for different features
- **Admin Consent Management** - Proper handling of admin consent requirements

## üîí Data Protection

### Data Classification
| Data Type | Classification | Protection Level |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| User Credentials | Highly Sensitive | Never stored client-side |
| Access Tokens | Sensitive | Memory only, auto-expired |
| Application Config | Internal | Encrypted in transit |
| Audit Logs | Internal | Tamper-proof logging |
| User Data | Sensitive | Encrypted, access controlled |

### Encryption Standards
- **TLS 1.3** - All communications encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **AES-256** - Industry-standard encryption for data at rest
- **Certificate Pinning** - Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy** - Session keys cannot be compromised retroactively

## üö® Threat Protection

### Common Attack Vectors & Mitigations

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Content Security Policy** - Strict CSP headers prevent script injection
- **Input Sanitization** - All user inputs properly sanitized
- **React Built-in Protection** - React's built-in XSS protection mechanisms
- **Trusted Types** - Implementation of Trusted Types API

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **SameSite Cookies** - CSRF protection through SameSite cookie attributes
- **Token Validation** - CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **Origin Validation** - Strict origin and referrer checking

#### Injection Attacks
- **Parameterized Queries** - No dynamic query construction
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive input validation and type checking
- **Graph API Protection** - Microsoft Graph API provides built-in injection protection

#### Session Management
- **Secure Session Handling** - Proper session lifecycle management
- **Session Timeout** - Automatic session expiration
- **Concurrent Session Control** - Detection and handling of concurrent sessions

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging
- **Comprehensive Logging** - All security-relevant events logged
- **Tamper-Proof Logs** - Cryptographically signed audit logs
- **Real-Time Alerting** - Immediate alerts for security incidents
- **Log Retention** - Secure log retention and archival policies

### Security Metrics
| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Failed login attempts | 5 per user per hour | Account lockout |
| Suspicious API calls | 10 per minute | Rate limiting |
| Privilege escalation | Any attempt | Immediate alert |
| Data exfiltration | Unusual patterns | Investigation trigger |

## üèõÔ∏è Compliance & Standards

### Industry Compliance
- **SOC 2 Type II** - Service Organization Control compliance
- **ISO 27001** - Information security management standards
- **GDPR** - General Data Protection Regulation compliance
- **CCPA** - California Consumer Privacy Act compliance

### Microsoft Security Standards
- **Microsoft SDL** - Security Development Lifecycle compliance
- **Azure Security Baseline** - Adherence to Azure security recommendations
- **Microsoft Cloud Security** - Integration with Microsoft cloud security services

### Data Residency
- **Regional Data Storage** - Data stored according to regional requirements
- **Cross-Border Transfer** - Compliant international data transfer mechanisms
- **Data Sovereignty** - Respect for national data sovereignty laws
- **Encryption in Transit** - All cross-border data transfers encrypted

## üîß Security Configuration
